              Electromagnetic Fields & Microwave Engineering
            </h3>
            <p class="note-description truncate">
              This comprehensive guide covers fundamental principles and
              advanced concepts of electromagnetic fields and microwave
              engineering, specifically structured for fourth-semester
              electrical engineering students. The material begins with a
              thorough review of vector calculus essentials, including detailed
              discussions of gradient, divergence, curl, and Stokes' theorem
              with practical engineering applications. Maxwell's equations are
              extensively covered, starting from their integral forms to
              differential forms, with detailed physical interpretations and
              engineering significance of each equation. The notes provide
              in-depth analysis of electromagnetic wave propagation in different
              media, including perfect dielectrics, lossy media, and conductors,
              with mathematical derivations and practical examples. Special
              attention is given to boundary conditions and interface phenomena,
              including reflection and refraction of electromagnetic waves at
              different material interfaces. The transmission line theory
              section covers distributed parameter analysis, including detailed
              treatment of the telegrapher's equations, wave propagation on
              transmission lines, impedance matching techniques, and Smith chart
              applications with numerous solved examples. The microwave portion
              includes comprehensive coverage of waveguides, including
              rectangular and circular waveguides, with detailed field pattern
              analysis, mode charts, and cutoff frequency calculations.
              Microwave resonators are thoroughly examined, including cavity
              resonators, dielectric resonators, and their applications in
              filter design and oscillator circuits. The material includes
              detailed analysis of microwave network parameters, including
              impedance parameters, admittance parameters, and scattering
              parameters, with practical measurement techniques and network
              analyzer operations. Microwave components are extensively covered,
              including detailed operation principles and design considerations
              for directional couplers, circulators, isolators, attenuators, and
              phase shifters. Special sections focus on microwave solid-state
              devices, including detailed coverage of microwave transistors, PIN
              diodes, Schottky diodes, and their applications in microwave
              circuits. The notes include comprehensive coverage of microwave
              measurements, including power measurements, frequency
              measurements, and impedance measurements, with practical
              laboratory procedures and safety considerations. Advanced topics
              include microstrip transmission lines, including design equations,
              impedance calculations, and practical layout considerations for
              microwave integrated circuits. Antenna fundamentals are covered,
              including radiation patterns, directivity, gain, and basic antenna
              types commonly used in microwave systems. The material includes
              detailed case studies of practical microwave systems, including
              radar systems, satellite communication systems, and modern
              wireless communication systems. Special attention is given to
              electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and interference (EMI) issues,
              including shielding techniques and regulatory compliance
              requirements. The notes include sections on computational
              electromagnetics, introducing numerical methods for solving
              electromagnetic problems, including finite difference and finite
              element methods. Modern applications in 5G communications,
              including millimeter-wave propagation characteristics and antenna
              array systems, are thoroughly discussed. The material includes
              practical design examples of microwave filters, amplifiers, and
              oscillators, with simulation results using industry-standard
              software tools. Additional sections cover emerging technologies in
              electromagnetic and microwave engineering, including
              metamaterials, photonic crystals, and quantum electromagnetics.
              Laboratory experiments are detailed, providing hands-on experience
              with microwave measurement equipment and system design.
